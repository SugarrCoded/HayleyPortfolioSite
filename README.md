# HayleyPortfolioSite

For my project, I decided to build a portfolio site that I can build on and add to as I grow. I will use my portfolio site to showcase my projects and my web development abilities.
I hope to grow as a web developer and turn this small hobby into a career.



The features I chose to include are as follows:

-A navigation menu that collapses into a mobile friendly version

-Media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two column desktop layout

-An image carousel with 5 images to rotate through

-Flexbox to rearrange two content areas as screen changes sizes



My project seems to work just fine on Windows operating systems and Mac. As of right now, there are no special instructions to load or to view my project.

Thank You for considering my project, I hope it meets expectation.
